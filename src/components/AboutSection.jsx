        Back in the early 2010's, I was trying to apply hex codes into GBA emulations and tinker
        with Cheat Engine shenanigans which would spearhead my delve into programming.
        Nowadays, I have recently graduated with a Software Engineering Degree from Ontario Tech
        University with a big interest in Full Stack Development and low level programming

      <p className=" mt-8 text-slate-400 indent-8">
        My main priority these days is building Full Stack Development projects with interesting data flows, whether thats from
        Spotify audio features and OpenAI's GPT capabilities. I've also started to delve into low level programming through C and
        building Protocols from the ground up.

        While the few times I'm not code monkeying at my desk, I'm usually reading, playing video games, and cooking.
